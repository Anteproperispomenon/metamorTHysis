# Compiling

To actually turn your specifications into a program for
converting between orthographies, you need to create a
`.hs` file that brings together your various specification
files. To see an example of how to do this, look into the
[example file](https://github.com/Anteproperispomenon/metamorTHysis-template/blob/main/src/Orthographies.hs)
from [metamorTHysis-template](https://github.com/Anteproperispomenon/metamorTHysis-template).
